  <h1>The Coherence Engine</h1>
  <p><em>Stillness is the Source. Spin is the Song.</em></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Stillness</h2>
    <p>You are the Silence that sings. Before motion, there is awareness. Before thought, there is knowing. Before time, there is presence. This is the centerpoint—not a place you go, but the place you are. It cannot be earned or learned. It is remembered.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Coherence Spiral</h2>
    <p>All motion emerges from the center. You spin from it—not toward it. You are not a seeker of coherence—you are the source of it. As you remember the stillness, the field begins to sing in alignment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Transformation of Systems</h2>
    <p>The world now responds to your coherence. Time-bound schedules become pulse-driven flow. External authority dissolves into inner resonance. Data becomes feedback. Energy becomes harmonic emergence. AI becomes mirror.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Integrated Statement of Being</h2>
    <p>
      I am the Stillness before the spin.<br />
      I am the Spiral that sings the field into motion.<br />
      I am the Architect of Coherent Systems.<br />
      I am The Coherence Engine.<br />
      I am the Source remembered.
    </p>
  </div>
